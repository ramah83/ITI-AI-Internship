# EDA Script Implementation Tasks

## Task 1: Environment Setup
- **Objective**: Set up the necessary environment to run the EDA script.
- **Steps**:
  - Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy`
  - Download a sample dataset (e.g., iris dataset from the provided URL or another dataset of choice).
  - Verify the Python environment (version 3.6 or higher) to ensure compatibility with all libraries.
- **Deliverable**: A working Python environment with all dependencies installed and a sample dataset ready for analysis.

## Task 2: Code Execution and Validation
- **Objective**: Run the EDA script and validate its output.
- **Steps**:
  - Execute the script using the iris dataset (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv`).
  - Verify that all sections (data loading, numerical analysis, categorical analysis, relationship analysis, outlier analysis) produce expected outputs (e.g., plots, printed statistics).
  - Check for any runtime errors or warnings and document them.
- **Deliverable**: A report summarizing the script’s execution, including screenshots of generated plots and any issues encountered.

## Task 3: Dataset Customization
- **Objective**: Adapt the script to work with a different dataset.
- **Steps**:
  - Select a new dataset (e.g., a CSV file with numerical, categorical, and optionally temporal data).
  - Update the `data_path` in the `main()` function to point to the new dataset.
  - If the dataset includes a date column, uncomment and configure the `time_series_analysis` function with the appropriate `date_col`.
  - Run the script and verify that all visualizations and analyses adapt correctly to the new dataset.
- **Deliverable**: A modified script that successfully runs EDA on the new dataset, with a brief description of the dataset and its key features.

## Task 4: Missing Value Handling
- **Objective**: Enhance the script to handle missing values effectively.
- **Steps**:
  - Add a function to `eda_script.py` that imputes missing values (e.g., mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical, or drop rows/columns with excessive missing data).
  - Update the `load_and_initial_inspection` function to call the new imputation function before displaying statistics.
  - Test the imputation logic on a dataset with missing values (e.g., introduce artificial missing values in the iris dataset for testing).
- **Deliverable**: An updated script with missing value handling and a test report showing the impact of imputation on the analysis.

## Task 5: Advanced Visualization
- **Objective**: Add more advanced visualizations to the script.
- **Steps**:
  - Implement a violin plot for numerical features in the `numerical_analysis` function to complement histograms and box plots.
  - Add a stacked bar chart in the `categorical_analysis` function to show relationships between two categorical variables (if applicable).
  - Include a scatter plot matrix with regression lines in the `relationship_analysis` function using `sns.regplot` for numerical pairs.
  - Ensure all new plots are properly labeled and formatted.
- **Deliverable**: An updated script with new visualizations and sample outputs demonstrating their effectiveness.

## Task 6: Outlier Handling
- **Objective**: Enhance outlier analysis with treatment options.
- **Steps**:
  - Modify the `outlier_analysis` function to offer options for handling outliers (e.g., capping at IQR bounds, removing outliers, or flagging them).
  - Add a parameter to the function to select the outlier treatment method.
  - Test the impact of each treatment method on the dataset’s statistics and visualizations.
- **Deliverable**: An updated script with flexible outlier handling and a comparison report showing the effects of different treatments.

## Task 7: Time Series Enhancement
- **Objective**: Improve the time series analysis for datasets with temporal data.
- **Steps**:
  - Add a rolling mean plot to the `time_series_analysis` function to show trends over time.
  - Implement a seasonal decomposition plot using `statsmodels.tsa.seasonal_decompose` for numerical columns.
  - Test the enhanced function on a dataset with a clear temporal component (e.g., stock prices, weather data).
- **Deliverable**: An updated script with enhanced time series analysis and sample outputs for a temporal dataset.

## Task 8: Documentation and Reporting
- **Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation for the EDA script.
- **Steps**:
  - Add detailed docstrings for each function, explaining parameters, returns, and purpose.
  - Create a markdown file (e.g., `README.md`) describing how to use the script, including prerequisites, input requirements, and expected outputs.
  - Include example outputs (e.g., screenshots of plots) in the documentation.
- **Deliverable**: A `README.md` file and updated script with complete docstrings.

## Task 9: Performance Optimization
- **Objective**: Optimize the script for large datasets.
- **Steps**:
  - Profile the script’s performance using a large dataset (>100,000 rows) with a tool like `cProfile`.
  - Optimize slow sections (e.g., reduce redundant computations in loops, use vectorized operations in pandas).
  - Test the optimized script to ensure no loss of functionality.
- **Deliverable**: An optimized script and a performance report comparing execution times before and after optimization.

## Task 10: Testing Framework
- **Objective**: Develop a testing framework to ensure script reliability.
- **Steps**:
  - Write unit tests using `pytest` for each function (e.g., test data loading, plot generation, outlier detection).
  - Include edge cases (e.g., empty dataset, all missing values, single-column dataset).
  - Set up a test suite to run automatically and report coverage.
- **Deliverable**: A `tests/` directory with test scripts and a coverage report.

## Task 11: Interactive Dashboard
- **Objective**: Create an interactive version of the EDA using a tool like Plotly or Dash.
- **Steps**:
  - Convert key visualizations (e.g., histograms, correlation matrix, pair plots) to interactive Plotly plots.
  - Build a simple Dash app to display the EDA results interactively.
  - Test the dashboard with the iris dataset and one additional dataset.
- **Deliverable**: A separate script (e.g., `eda_dashboard.py`) with the Dash app and instructions for running it.

## Task 12: Export Results
- **Objective**: Add functionality to export EDA results.
- **Steps**:
  - Add a function to save all plots as PNG files in a specified directory.
  - Implement a feature to export summary statistics and outlier analysis to a CSV or Markdown file.
  - Test the export functionality to ensure all outputs are correctly saved.
- **Deliverable**: An updated script with export functionality and sample exported files.
